Cross Chain Pay-roll Management using AA -> Get paid and Pay with any Crypto Currency seamlessly using SafePay

# Features 

Using this system, companies can easily pay their employees with any cryptocurrency or fiat currency, which could potentially lead to faster, more secure, and cheaper transactions than traditional payroll methods.

Additionally, using smart contracts for payroll management reduces the risk of fraud, errors, and disputes by automating payroll calculations and payments.

Account abstraction could make this system much more efficient and cost-effective. By abstracting the user's account, it separates the user's private key from their on-chain address.

This means the private key could be stored safely and remotely, and only the user can transfer funds from the account. This would increase the security of the system and reduce the risk of a breach.
